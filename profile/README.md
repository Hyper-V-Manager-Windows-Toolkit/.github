## üñå Overview

**Hyper-V Manager** is a professional **virtualization tool for Windows 10 and 11** that enables users to run multiple operating systems on a single machine. Developed by Microsoft, it provides developers, testers, and IT administrators with a secure and efficient way to create and manage virtual environments.  

The platform offers powerful virtualization technology with support for dynamic memory, checkpoints, and hardware acceleration. Its interface is clean and intuitive, allowing users to configure storage, network adapters, and processor allocation in just a few clicks.  

Built into **Windows Pro and Enterprise editions**, Hyper-V integrates seamlessly with **PowerShell**, enabling advanced automation and scripting for enterprise deployment. Users can also manage remote hosts, replicate virtual machines, and perform live migrations without downtime.  

**Hyper-V Manager Windows Toolkit** enhances performance and stability for virtualization workflows. It supports both **generation 1 and 2 VMs**, virtual TPM for Windows 11 testing, and GPU-assisted acceleration for AI and graphics workloads.  

Ideal for developers building cross-platform software, cybersecurity professionals testing sandboxed environments, and enterprises running secure infrastructures, Hyper-V Manager delivers enterprise-grade virtualization right from the desktop.
